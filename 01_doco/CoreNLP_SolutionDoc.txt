-----Steps to setup from the official release------

This example goes over how to set up CoreNLP from the latest official release. This example will take you through downloading the package, and running a simple command-line invocation of CoreNLP.

Prerequisites

Java 8. The command java -version should complete successfully with a line like: java version “1.8.0_92”.
Zip tool
For following exactly the steps below: bash or a similar shell, and wget or a similar downloader.
Steps

Download the CoreNLP zip file at: http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/index.html#download:
wget http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-corenlp-full-2018-01-31.zip
Or using curl (what you get by default on macOS):

curl -O http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-corenlp-full-2018-01-31.zip
Unzip the release:
unzip stanford-corenlp-full-2018-01-31.zip
Enter the newly unzipped directory:
cd stanford-corenlp-full-2018-01-31

Set up your classpath. If you’re using an IDE, you should set the classpath in your IDE. If you are using bash or a bash-like shell, the following will work:::

for file in `find . -name "*.jar"`; do export
CLASSPATH="$CLASSPATH:`realpath $file`"; done

If you’ll be using CoreNLP frequently, the below line is a useful line to have in your ~/.bashrc (or equivalent) file, replacing the directory /path/to/corenlp/ with the appropriate path to where you unzipped CoreNLP:::

for file in `find /path/to/corenlp/ -name "*.jar"`; do export
CLASSPATH="$CLASSPATH:`realpath $file`"; done

Try it out! For example, the following will make a simple text file to annotate, and run CoreNLP over this file. The output will be saved to input.txt.out as a JSON file. Note that running all the CoreNLP annotators in the default annotation pipeline requires quite a bit of memory. You should give it at least 3GB (-mx3g) in most cases:::

echo "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" > input.txt
java -mx3g edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLP -outputFormat json -file input.txt


##had to install homebrew, then a specific instance of 'realpath' to get the 'realpath' to work.
https://brew.sh
http://blog.ivansiu.com/blog/2014/05/01/os-x-get-full-path-of-file-using-realpath/


If you're using -cp "*", you should be running this command in the directory where you installed StanfordCoreNLP (e.g. /home/stanford-corenlp-full-2015-12-09/).

Make sure that do one of the following

You run the command inside the corenlp installation path
You change -cp "*" to the installation path (i.e. -cp "/home/stanford-corenlp-full-2015-12-09/")
You add the installation path to the CLASSPATH environment variable
You can find more info here: https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/cmdline.html


java -mx4g -cp "*" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLP -outputFormat json -file input.txt

java -mx4g -cp "*" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLP -outputFormat xml -file input.txt





------Python Wrapper for CoreNLP------

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39410282/coreference-resolution-in-python-nltk-using-stanford-corenlp
As mentioned by @Igor You can try the python wrapper implemented in this GitHub repo: https://github.com/dasmith/stanford-corenlp-python

This repo contains two main files: corenlp.py client.py

Perform the following changes to get coreNLP working:

In the corenlp.py, change the path of the corenlp folder. Set the path where your local machine contains the corenlp folder and add the path in line 144 of corenlp.py

if not corenlp_path:
    corenlp_path = <path to the corenlp file>
The jar file version number in "corenlp.py" is different. Set it according to the corenlp version that you have. Change it at line 135 of corenlp.py

jars = ["stanford-corenlp-3.4.1.jar",
                "stanford-corenlp-3.4.1-models.jar",
                "joda-time.jar",
                "xom.jar",
                "jollyday.jar"]
In this replace 3.4.1 with the jar version which you have downloaded.

Run the command:

python corenlp.py
This will start a server

Now run the main client program

python client.py
This provides a dictionary and you can access the coref using 'coref' as the key:

For example: John is a Computer Scientist. He likes coding.

{
     "coref": [[[["a Computer Scientist", 0, 4, 2, 5], ["John", 0, 0, 0, 1]], [["He", 1, 0, 0, 1], ["John", 0, 0, 0, 1]]]]
}
I have tried this on Ubuntu 16.04. Use java version 7 or 8.
